Since it’s 09:47 AM CEST on Thursday, July 03, 2025, I’ll provide a textual representation of a wiring diagram for your Olimex ESP32-PoE-EA-16MB-WROVER-based smart home node, as I can’t generate graphical images directly. This diagram will cover the pin connections and wiring design outlined in the GitHub Markdown write-up, tailored to your setup with 8 indoor nodes in 60mm x 50mm wall boxes. The diagram focuses on the ESP32, TCA9548A I2C multiplexer, sensors, I2S devices, 433 MHz module, and power/heat considerations, fitting your house (concrete downstairs, wood/hay upstairs, 10m outdoor perimeter) requirements.

| DHT22        | 3.3V (ESP32) |
| CCS811       | 3.3V (ESP32) |
| BH1750       | 3.3V (ESP32) |
| HC-SR501     | 5V (PoE)     |

| MAX98357A    | 5V (PoE)     |
| Speaker      | 5V (PoE via MAX98357A) |
| 433 MHz      | 5V (PoE)     |
| OLED         | 3.3V (ESP32) |
|---------------------------|
- PoE input via RJ45, fused with 1A inline fuse on Cat6 positive line.
- Common GND across all components tied to ESP32 GND.
```

#### Audio and Antenna Wiring
```
|---------------------------|
| Device       | Wiring      |
|--------------|-------------|
| INMP441      | Shielded cable from GPIO 32, 33, 35 to mic, GND to ESP32 GND |
| MAX98357A    | Shielded cable from GPIO 15, 16, 17 to amp, Speaker to amp output, GND to ESP32 GND |
| Antenna      | External U.FL antenna connected to ESP32 antenna port, oriented vertically |
|---------------------------|
- Use twisted pair or shielded cables for I2S to reduce noise.
```

#### Heat and Physical Layout
```
|---------------------------|
| Component    | Placement   |
|--------------|-------------|
| ESP32        | Vertical mount, heat sink on top |
| MAX98357A    | Adjacent to ESP32, heat sink on amp |
| TCA9548A     | Mounted near I2C sensors, secured with adhesive |
| Sensors      | Positioned to avoid heat (e.g., MQ135 away from amp) |
| Speaker      | Mounted on box wall, facing outward |
| Antenna      | Routed through box vent |
|---------------------------|
- Drill 2mm vents on box top/bottom for passive cooling.
- Use standoffs or adhesive to secure components, avoiding loose wires.
```

#### Wiring Considerations
- **Pin Constraints**: All 12 pins are used; TCA9548A ensures I2C devices (CCS811, BH1750, OLED) share GPIO 21/22. Avoid GPIO 0, 2, 15 for peripherals unless boot-configured.
- **Power Management**: Route 5V and 3.3V lines separately, with a 1A fuse on the PoE input to protect against shorts. Use a breadboard or custom PCB for tidy connections.
- **Heat Mitigation**: Heat sinks on ESP32 and MAX98357A reduce thermal buildup (~60–75°C expected). Monitor with DHT22; adjust ventilation if nearing 85°C.
- **Interference**: Shield 433 MHz wiring with foil to minimize 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi interference. Test VLAN traffic with the managed switch.
- **Box Fit**: Stagger components vertically to fit 50mm depth, with the antenna exiting via a vent.

### Notes
- This diagram assumes a single node; replicate for all 8. Adjust pin assignments if conflicts arise (e.g., GPIO 15 boot issues).
- The TCA9548A’s I2C addresses (0x70–0x77) can be set with A0/A1/A2 jumpers; confirm with your OLED/ sensors.
- Heat and fire risks are low with the fuse and vents, as previously assessed.
